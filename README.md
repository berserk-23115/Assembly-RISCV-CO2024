## Project Overview
This project involves developing software that converts the assembly code for RISCV32 ISA ( Instruction Set Architecture ) into machine code for RISC V-based processors and their simulation  in virtual machines. 
### About RISC-V
RISC V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture developed by RISCV Foundation.   RISC V comes in three standard base versions with 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit address spaces. It  is scalable and suitable for various devices, from embedded systems and microcontrollers to high-performance computing (HPC) applications.

### Features of Assembler
#### Error Detection : 

Invalid Instruction\
Invalid Register Declaration\
Missing Virtual Halt Instruction\
Virtual Halt Instruction not used as terminatory instruction\
Immediate passed is out of bounds
